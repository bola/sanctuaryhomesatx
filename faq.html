            <!-- Getting Started -->
            <div class="faq-category">
                <h2 class="faq-category-title">Getting Started</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do I start the custom home building process with Sanctuary?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Begin by scheduling a consultation through our <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. We'll discuss your vision, budget, timeline, and site details. If it's a good fit, we'll move into the preconstruction phase where we refine plans, finalize budgets, and secure permits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do I need to have architectural plans before contacting you?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">No. While many clients come to us with existing plans from their architect, it's not required. We can recommend trusted architects and designers who align with your aesthetic and needs, and we work collaboratively throughout the design process.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What areas do you serve?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We build throughout Austin and the Texas Hill Country, including West Lake Hills, Westlake, Tarrytown, Zilker, Bouldin, Barton Creek, Dripping Springs, Wimberley, and Fredericksburg. If your project is outside these areas, contact us—we may still be able to help.</p>

            <!-- Process & Timeline -->
            <div class="faq-category">
                <h2 class="faq-category-title">Process & Timeline</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's the typical timeline for a custom home build?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Most custom homes take 10-14 months from groundbreaking to completion. The preconstruction phase (design, permits, planning) typically adds another 2-3 months. Your specific timeline will depend on project complexity, site conditions, and finishes selected.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I visit the construction site during the build?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely! We encourage regular site visits. Your dedicated project manager will schedule weekly walkthroughs, and you're welcome to visit anytime with advance notice. We also provide photo updates and progress reports through our online portal.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How involved will I be in the building process?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">As involved as you want to be. We provide regular updates and decision points throughout construction, but we handle all coordination, scheduling, and vendor management. Your main involvement will be selections, approvals, and weekly check-ins.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- Budget & Pricing -->

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do you handle budget management?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">We use transparent, line-item budgeting throughout your project. You'll have real-time access to costs via our project portal. Any change orders are documented and approved before work begins—no surprises at the end.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's included in your estimates?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Our detailed estimates include all construction costs, permits, materials, labor, subcontractor fees, and project management. We'll clearly outline what's included and what's not (such as land costs, architectural fees, or specialty items) during the preconstruction phase.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you offer design-build services?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">While we don't have in-house architects, we work closely with some of Austin's best design professionals and can recommend partners who align with your aesthetic and needs. We're experienced in both design-assist and plan-and-spec projects.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer">For five years after move-in, you have a dedicated concierge—your single point of contact for anything related to your home. We coordinate all warranty claims, schedule repairs, dispatch vendors, and provide maintenance guidance. It's like having a building expert on retainer.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What makes Sanctuary different from other custom builders?</div>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Three things: our Home Cloud™ digital handover system, 5-year concierge service, and genuine commitment to long-term client relationships. 90% of our business comes from referrals—our clients become our advocates.

                    <p class="faq-answer">We provide a comprehensive warranty covering workmanship and materials, plus manufacturer warranties on all products and systems. Our 5-year concierge service manages all warranty claims on your behalf—you make one call, and we handle the coordination.</p>

We'll assess the issue, coordinate with the appropriate vendor or subcontractor, schedule the repair, and follow up to ensure it's resolved. You won't be left tracking down contacts or managing repairs yourself.</p>
